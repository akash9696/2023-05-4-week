### 1 Principle: Learning vs Winning The System

1.  The focus must shift from simply winning a system, to actually long term learning.
2.  Maybe accepting a job that surrounds you with with people smarter than you so that you can grow & learn in long term is a better strategy than winning the system and just trying to impress the boss.
3.  You always have a choice to focus on long term learning which always beat out winning the system.

### 2 Principle: What Is Success ?

1.  Does success come by being Smart ?
2.  Not necessarily.
3.  Drive & Persistence can actually lead to success.
4.  At the end of the day, you need to work hard for what you want and the easy route is taken by those with no drive & persistence.
5.  To succeed, you will need to take risks and make mistakes, you have to do the unconventional.
6.  Those who succeed are the ones who takes the path less travelled and have drive and persistence.

### 3 Principle: The Obstacle

1.  No matter what, when we learn any new topic, we’re going to encounter this obstacle that you suck, you can literally have to see how far you have to go to stop sucking.
2.  Maybe you think that it is possible to get to that end goal, but it is just seems like it’s going to take such a long time, trying becomes just too much work.
3.  But you have to shift this focus of obstacles, when you encounter an obstacle and your brain says no you can’t do it or you suck.
4.  You have to change it to good, I’m doing something worthwhile.
5.  Instead of our ego being protected because we don’t want to suck, we want to change the focus to saying good, I’m learning a skill that probably others are feeling the same thing, they’re going to turn around, but that’s not me.
6.  I am going to keep going because this is what makes a skill, a topic valuable to learn, because nobody is good at anything at first.
7.  At first you’re just beginner when you take a test and get the wrong answer.
8.  If you succeeded right away and you didn’t encounter any obstacles, that’s actually a bad thing because, you won’t learn the hard lessons that failure teach, the thing you want to do and the path you want to go on, the learning you want to do, the new career that you want to take, the new business that you wanna start.
9.  Most people won’t do them because of these obstacles, but the obstacles are the path that others abandon.
10.  What you do when you encounter those failures will define your future success.
11.  When you feel that you are suck, congro, you found something that people aren’t willing to do and this is what’s going to make your skill valuable.

### 4 Principle: The Dip

1.  When you try to learn something or achieve mastery, there are going to be some low points when you feel like you’re never gonna get there, we already talked about in the Obstacle Principle.
2.  But you have to accept that there can be a possibility that you’re simply not cut for the path ahead, because not everybody can become anything.
3.  Seth Godin also talked about this in his Book [The Dip](https://www.notion.so/The-Dip-f1623e12661c4fc997f310fa1ed0e2fa), that you can try hard and do things and push through and have perseverance and drive, But sometimes the path might be a wrong pursuit for you.
4.  And it is important to know when to quit, to turn around and do something different rather to push and go over the Obstacles.
5.  When you hear you can do anything you set your mind to, may be but we have limited capacity in our Brains. Also we have limited time on this Earth.
6.  So the path we pick has to be a smart one, a smart choice, push enough so that you can overcome those obstacles, but also know when the dip is there and when you should turn around.

### 5 Principle: Compounding Learning

1.  This idea is came form the Finance term - [Compounding Interest](https://www.notion.so/Compounding-Interest-4031b37ae9264e68b5721d0590c48aab), but this principle when applied to the learning, leverages the fact that learning occurs everyday in our life, that is, we want to shift our focus from just cramming as much information as we want in a huge, full day learning session into just little small chunks.
2.  This idea is to make small changes every single day.
3.  For example - you don’t want to once a week go all out for 5 hours, run & exercise and stay in the gym for 5 hours for just 1 day v/s just spending 20 minutes each day.
4.  The idea is you don’t have to dedicate a whole lot of time learning a topic and just erase everything else from your life and just struggle and be in pain as you learn 12 hours a day.
5.  Instead, every single day try to do small little things because
    1.  If you improve by 1% a day in 70 days, you’re actually twice as good according to Compound Learning
6.  You don’t have to shut yourself in a room for an entire month and just learn a topic instead all you have to do is be persistent and each day do little bit by bit and spending just 20 minutes each day on Focused Learning.
7.  It means that each week you’ll have 2 hours of knowledge that you develop and that over lifetime is always going to beat out anybody that just spends one week on an intense session and then get burned out and never continues.
8.  We’re in this for the long run.
9.  These small changes that we make each day have a compounding effects later on in our lives.

### 6 Principle: Failures Don’t Count

1.  Every person that you meet today experiences you as you right now, and they don’t care about the tests that you failed 5 years ago.
2.  They only know you as your current state right now.
3.  It’s that you don’t have to be successful a lot, as a matter of fact, you can be successful just 1% of the time.
4.  Your mistakes don’t count against you.
5.  And this is what happens when you see people that are super successful, when you ask them about their success, most of the time their answer is through years of failures & practice & drive to constantly improve. Nobody become successful in just blink of an eye.
6.  When you do something badly, you don’t do something well, It feels like you didn’t accomplish anything.
7.  The truth is actually opposite, Every time you make a mistake anytime you fail, you learn something. It gives you feedback on what you should do next time.
8.  Every failure brings you closer to where you want to be instead of being the type of person that avoids doing things because you’re afraid of failing, you’re afraid of judgment.
9.  Start using this principle and realize that these failures just don’t count against you.
10.  Each time you make a mistake, you have a failure, You get closer and closer to your goal.
11.  And those that never try will never, ever beat out those that try and fail.

### **7 Principle: Choice vs Chore**

1.  It’s a choice, not a chore, to do something when you have to think to yourself.
2.  I need to go exercise. And this feel like a chore long term.
3.  You’re not going to keep exercising because it’s like washing dishes or doing laundry not many people enjoy those tasks and we do it because we have to, But when it comes to learning, it feels like a chore.
4.  You probably won’t continue to do it because unlike clothes that get dirty or dishes that get dirty, there’s no physical evidence of our lack of learning.
5.  So instead, we want to shift our focus and start thinking of learning as a choice.
6.  Chores are temporary and they won’t last long.
7.  But if you start to shift your focus & realise that learning is a choice, you can’t do anything today, you can take a rest for the rest of the week. That is a choice.
8.  Or you can say I’m making a choice to learn every day for 20 minutes when we shift our focus from chore, something that you have to do to a choice, something that you will do that you want to do, that shifts your focus.
9.  And long term, the choice will always beat out the chore

### 8 Principle: It’s All In The Frame

1.  Framing is an important concept when it comes to learning, because almost nothing in this world is objective.
2.  Most things are subjective, that is we as humans interpret them in different ways. For example, a bird might be sweet and loving to someone and scary to others.
3.  Frames are what humans used to change perspectives.
4.  Almost everything in this world has different contexts or different frames that you can use to view things in a different way.
5.  As you can notice all the lessons in this Principle Section are all about the way we think, the way we look at things, the way we look at obstacles, the way we look at the choice and try to learn all of these things are allowing us to have a different perspective on the topic of learning.
6.  For example when you encounter frustration, when learning, when you feel like you suck instead of feeling like this doesn’t feel good, I am just not good enough.
7.  Notice this and say, oh, I am growing. This feeling as me growing as an individual. Me learning & pushing, me overcoming an obstacle.
8.  Refrain this idea of I’m not there yet. Other people are better than me and I will learn from them so that I can get there.
9.  I have a choice to practice 20 minutes each day so that I can get to where I want to be.
10.  And I can get to that point where somebody that I respect Is, that’s the beginner mindset.
11.  And the Idea of framing is exactly that.
12.  It’s moving these dark, negative ideas where we don’t have control over our future, over our life, over our learning into shifting it and looking out from a different perspective, from a different frame of mind, having a beginner mindset instead of a beginner attitude.
13.  This was this section of Principles meant for, to shift your focus, shift your perspective into what you can control instead of what we have no control over

### 9 Principle: Pareto Principle

1.  Also known as the 80-20 rule, which is the idea of the law of vital few.
2.  It’s the idea that roughly 80% of the results, the effects usually comes from 20% of the causes or inputs.
3.  We can use this principle in many cases like in Management, Coding.
4.  This is the principle and it is about eliminating things, eliminating 100% down to 20%.
5.  What’s 20% which is going to get you 80% results.
6.  Most people think of mastering a topic as taking a lifetime to become the best in the world at something takes your entire life.
7.  May be it’s right but most of the time, to become a master at something usually means around being top 5% of the world. It doesn’t mean that you have to be the number 1 person, Mastery simply means you’re in the top 5%.
8.  And in order to be a master of something, you need to figure out what are the critical skills that are going to give you the biggest results.
9.  The closer we get to the 100% mastery, the longer and longer it takes, but usually the initial 80% can be achieved quite fast.
10.  This principle is crucial in our understanding of being efficient learners.
11.  Remember this → Is this the best use of my time. Adding things doesn’t necessarily mean better. Instead focus on that core 20%

### 10 Principle: Skill Stacking

1.  In the Book [Mastery](https://www.notion.so/Mastery-4a41a3f8988042eb913daa4bfe750918) by Robert Green, he mentioned that there’s 3 approaches when it comes to career strategy.
    1.  Curiosity -
        1.  All masters of a craft stay in touch with their curiosity, they are always curious about the topic and they have this childlike ambition to learn
    2.  Value learning above all else -
        1.  Choosing the opportunity that allows you to learn the best, such as accepting a job because you’re surrounding by people way smarter than you. Instead of picking a job because it has the highest salary.
    3.  Gathering & Combining skills in a unique way -
        1.  This is the most important, Instead of getting good at one thing, you want to be get good at multiple things & combining them, stacking your skills in different unique ways that is unique to you.
        2.  By combining these you can create a little niche for yourself where you’re considered one of a kind, because to really be a master of something, to be the top in the world at something, it requires a lifetime of dedication.
        3.  For some people, that’s easy, but there’s only one spot in the world for a master.
        4.  And the truth is you probably will never be the best in the world at any specific skill not to disappoint you, but there’s always going to be somebody working harder than you, spending more time than you.
        5.  There’ll always be somebody with better genetic gifts than you, maybe even more luck.
        6.  But there’s an advantage that can be had here.
        7.  Maybe you’re not best in the world but with skill stacking, it’s actually more effective to be in the top 20, top 10% in several different skills that you can stack together that is completely unique to you so that you can be in the 1% in that skill.
        8.  For example combining coding & communication or business skill, Your skill become more valuable when you stack them on top of one another.
2.  Key with the Skill Stacking is to have skills that work well together, but that are also varied enough to make you stand out.
3.  So the main point of this principle is that
    1.  It’s not about being the greatest at one thing, You just need to be pretty good at a list of useful skills that, when combined, makes you truly one of a kind.

### 11 Principle: Happiness Factor

1.  The main idea here is to find all your key happiness factors in order for you to be efficient learner, to enjoy ‘what you are doing’, ‘growing’ & ‘learning’, you need to be happy.
2.  If you're in a negative space, if you're not in a good place in your life, you're automatically at a disadvantage in learning.
3.  You want to hit targets inside yourself that make you happy so that you can focus on these big goals and ambitions that involve learning so that you can take risks and be OK with failing to overcome obstacles, because you are OK with those obstacles.
4.  And this is what I actually do my daily life. I have 5 to 7 happiness factors that I always monitor.
5.  For example, look at your everyday life and think about what are the key things that make you happy.
6.  For example, for me, work is a big part of my happiness factor.
    1.  Every day I work and if work is not enjoyable, that's going to affect my happiness.
    2.  Another one is friends and family, right? If I don't have good friend group, a good family, well, then I'm not going to be happy.
    3.  Another one is learning and growth. I enjoy knowing that I improve every day, that I am learning something new every day and that actually contributes to my happiness factor.
    4.  Another one might be health and fitness, feeling healthy and energized. Each morning when I wake up and feeling like I can take on the world, everybody has different happiness factors.
    5.  I want you to do is to write down 5 to 7 and try to monitor them throughout your learning career.
7.  By making sure these happiness factors are met, you put yourself in a better state of learning. If you write it down, it will help you monitor, maintain and improve them every few months.
8.  I usually use a score from 1 to 5 to grade how each of my happiness factors are doing. It's very rare to have all of them at optimum 5, but it is good to monitor and be aware of their levels.

### 12 Principle: Your Productivity Time

1.  What is your productivity time?
2.  You see, everybody is different, although most jobs start a nine and finish at five.
3.  That's not the best way of doing things
4.  Because some people are morning people they love waking up early in the morning and they feel the most productive in the morning. And some people are just nighthawks. They love working at night, staying up late.
5.  What you want to do is to figure out what your productivity time is, for example, if you struggle to get out of the bed in the morning and you feel really groggy, then the Learning for you maybe shouldn't happen in the morning.
6.  Or if you're like me and you love going to bed early and waking up early and the first four hours that you wake up, you feel the best.
7.  That's when you should structure your learning.
8.  The key is that there's no one better than the other. Every person is different.
9.  And your job is to figure out what your productivity times are & what area throughout the day are you are the most productive and making sure that learning will happen in those zones.
10.  If you chose the wrong time to structure your work, eventually after a month, you give up because you're just not having fun and you're not enjoying.
11.  So find your productivity time and give yourself the permission to study. When you feel the best. Everyone is different.

### 13 Principle: Self Learning Paradigm

1.  This part, I would say was the toughest part to make because there is a lot of concepts that just simply shift your focus, shift your perspective, shift your frame.
2.  But all these Principles can be combined into this idea of the **Self Learning Paradigm**.
3.  You have to choose for yourself to be a self learner.
4.  Nobody's going to tell you to learn a topic, to improve your skills, to develop further and further each day.
5.  That is a choice that you have to make sure you're going to have external factors like changes in your job or maybe breakup's or maybe different promotions at your job.
6.  Sometimes you may find that a skill you're learning is no longer fun and you want to pursue something different.
7.  You want to learn a new skill instead of improving on an existing one.
8.  The idea of the self learning paradigm is that you need that intrinsic motivation.
9.  You need to, from inside of yourself, decide that this is why you want to do.
10.  And that is the choice that you make, that you will continue to learn each day to be an efficient learner each day.
11.  And that motivation cannot be taught by me, cannot be convinced by some random person on YouTube or a random book that has to come from within.
12.  But because you're already in this course, you have that inner motivation, which luckily is going to take you very far.

## Principle’s Summary

1. This section is about changing our mindset, as we will see in the science section that our brain has the property of `neuroplasticity` which means it can evolve and change throughout our lives based on the different actions & Inputs.
2. Confused with self-help, rather this section will try & lay the critical thinking & foundation that we need for the rest of this course.
3. Just watching these Principles will not make you a better person rather you need to be introduced to these principles to make you realize some truths about the world we live in so that you’re ready for the future sections.
4. In the end this section may make you feel good, but without the rest of the sections, it won’t do much for you.
5. This section is about adjusting our brains to look at the world in a different way a place that we have no control over and we react to instead to a place that we have control over and we can shape.

---

1.  In this section, we tried to adjust our brains, our perspectives to look at the world in a different way from a place that we have no control over that we react to, to a place that we have control over. We have choices and choices that we can shape.
2.  Learning versus winning the system
    1.  That instead of finding a way to just get good grades just because you want to do well on a test, to focus instead of this idea of long term learning, what will help you learn in the long term?
3.  Success
    1.  That everybody has a different idea of success. But being smart doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to be successful.
    2.  You need to have that drive and passion to lead to success.
4.  Obstacle
    1.  That how we want to shift our focus from whenever we feel that insecurity, that we're not good at something that we suck, that those are actually things that are going to make us better, that make our skills worthwhile.
    2.  Most people are going to turn around when they see an obstacle, but that's not you and you're going to push forward because that's what makes you valuable and unique.
5.  Dip
    1.  That Sometimes we need to understand, when should we need to turn around and try a different path.
6.  Compound Learning
    1.  This idea that you don't have to just necessarily go all out and study 12 hours a day instead, it's all about small little daily learnings that are going to make you successful and an efficient learner in the long term.
7.  Failures Don't Count
    1.  They don’t count against us, that we can fail a hundred thousands, millions of times.
    2.  All that matters is where we are now in our current state. And the more failures we have, the more feedback we're going to get to improve.
8.  Choices vs Chores
    1.  That we should view learning as a choice, not a chore.
9.  Framing
    1.  To frame and look at things as a way for us to grow and improve instead of in a negative light.
    2.  That's what we did with the obstacles, right.
10.  Pareto Principle of the 80-20 rule
    1.  That we don't necessarily need to get to 100 percent right from the bat.
    2.  Instead, it's about this idea of what are the vital things, the 20 percent that accounts for 80 percent of our results.
11.  Skill Stacking
    1.  That we don't have to spend our entire lives getting at a one thing which is really, really difficult.
    2.  There's always going to be people smarter than us that work harder than us.
    3.  But with skill stacking, we can make our different skills, the combination of skills unique so that we stand out and we become valuable.
12.  Happiness Factor
    1.  That we need to make sure that we're happy within ourselves, that our happiness factors are taken care of so that we have the foundation to learn and do well and continue to learn.
13.  Our own Productivity Time
    1.  By now we know when our learning should happen within a day.
14.  Self Learning Paradigm
    1.  That to be a self learner is a choice.
    2.  You have to be motivated to continue to learn and that no amount of money or external rewards or pats make us become an efficient learner, a strong self learner.
    3.  We have to be motivated and decide that starting today we take learning as a priority in our lives.
    4.  And you're going to make the choice to become a self learner, to continue to learn and have learning be a part of your daily practice.
