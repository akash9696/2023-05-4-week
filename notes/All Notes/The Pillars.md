### 1 Pillar: Everything Is A Game

1. 

### Summary

1. Now we're at a crucial point in the course. And that is the pillars we're going to be talking about, the four pillars which are going to be the foundational concepts that allow us to learn about the science and the techniques.
2. When it comes to efficient learning. These pillars are going to finalize our mental model and set us up for the last two sections when we actually develop the skills to become efficient learners, to become smart learners.
3. These pillars are what connects all the techniques we're going to learn into one, because you'll notice that all the techniques actually stand on these four pillars.
4. And every time we remember these four pillars, even after we're done with the course, you're going to be able to remember these techniques because each of the techniques are going to be standing on one of these pillars.
