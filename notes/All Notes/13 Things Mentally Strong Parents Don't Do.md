- What’s in it for me? In these blinks, you’ll learn
	- Fortify your own mental strength to raise kids who’ll be ready to take on all of life’s challenges.
	- How can you ensure that you’re teaching your kids the right skills and values?
	- What do your children need most in order to become self-reliant, responsible, happy adults?
	- Positive emotional and behavioral development is just as integral to success as, say, academic achievement.
	- why guilt can lead to poor parenting choices;
	- how a _praise-criticism-praise_ sandwich can motivate your child to do his best; and
	- how to write a family mission statement that encompasses your values.

- [[Frederick Douglass]] once said, “It’s easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.”
- [[Amy Morin]] argues that it’s just as important to know what unhealthy habits _not_ to teach children. 
	- As a foster mother and family therapy expert, she’s discovered through experience that parents need to work on their own behaviors in order to raise mentally strong children. 
	- These blinks draw deeply on both research and Morin’s own clients to show how common parenting practices can actually be detrimental to your child’s growth – and what you should do instead.


1. Mentally strong parents promote responsibility and perseverance over a victim mentality.
