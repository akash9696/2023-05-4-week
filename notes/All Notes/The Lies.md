### 1 Lie: Follow Your Passion

1.  **Follow Your Passion** â†’ this advice is often not a good advice.
2.  In one of the best books I've ever read by [[@ Cal Newport]] titled, [[So Good They Can't Ignore You]] he gives the advice that passion is simply overrated.
3.  For example, I was passionate or has love for travelling. So I thought, I should get into the travel industry because I'm passionate about travel.
4.  And it took me years to realise that just because I liked doing something doesn't mean that, that's what my work career needs to be as well, because I may be passionate about something that I enjoy purely as a leisure activity.
5.  But as soon as it turns into work. That leisure activity that was fun that you were passionate about turns into a chore.
6.  And we want to turn our attention from following our passion to working hard at something, learning something, learning a valuable skill and getting better.
7.  And that act of getting better at something, getting smarter, getting more and more recognition, having more people recognise you as an expert.
8.  That act of self-improvement and that act of self recognition is what actually makes you enjoy your job, enjoy your skills and enjoy your career. #imp-line
9.  Many people who actually love what they do don't have a passion for it.
10. For example, I'm a software engineer. Can I say that I'm passionate about coding and programming?
11. Not really.
12. I'm not really passionate about it, but I enjoy the process of getting better and better.
13. And the more success I had in my career, the more I enjoyed it, the more I became passionate about the topic.
14. But this wasn't an innate thing in me.
15. I just forced myself to learn something that I thought was difficult and valuable.
16. All you need is a little bit of interest in a topic, then by learning and improving over and over, it becomes more and more enjoyable because you go from a beginner to somebody that has a valuable skill.
17. So you don't need passion. What you actually need is creativity, control and impact. #imp-line
18. If we're able to be creative with our skill, If we're able to have control over our lives and dictate while we work on, If we're able to have impact in the world and do something worthwhile, by combining those 3 things with a valuable skill set, that passion arises.
19. So the passion mindset should be trashed.
20. Don't ask about what the world can offer you, what is my passion and what is my destiny.
21. Instead, tell yourself that getting better is a craft. Learning is a craft and learn to love the process of getting better and better.
22. This is called the craftsman mindset and the craftsman mindset, asks how can I improve and have something uniquely valuable to offer the world?
23. The Craftsman mindset says, instead of just following my passion and finding that perfect job instead work hard, put your head down, learn a valuable skill, combine different skills and get really, really good. #imp-line
24. Get so good that they can't ignore you.
25. You need to earn that great skill, great career, and the world doesn't owe you anything. The process won't be easy, but the process and the hard work is what gets you there.

### 2 Lie: You can Avoid Risk

1. The truth is that you can't avoid risk.
2. Risk is part of the process to really achieve anything worthwhile.
3. You have to be able to tolerate and enjoy taking risks, when you're doing something that you're not comfortable with.
4. Maybe you're about to give a speech in front of a hundred people. You get those butterflies in your stomach, you get sweaty palms, your heart starts beating faster.
5. When you notice those butterflies in your stomach, that's when you know you're stretching your boundaries, that's when you know you're doing something that others aren't willing to do.
6. You're doing something that improves you, makes you better.
7. And anybody that plays it safe doesn't take any risks in their life are going to be left behind by those that take those risks.
8. Because as we've learned in [[The Principles]], that it doesn't really matter how often you fail.
9. What matters is that last success that you had.
10. So start viewing risks as challenges to look forward to and in all fields, in all careers, in all topics and skills, in order to make exceptional discoveries or leaps in skill, you need to have risk.
11. You can never play it safe if you want to do anything worthwhile.
12. If you want to improve a skill and learn efficiently, you will have to take risks.
13. You will have to give up something to improve it.

### 3 Lie: Trust This One Person

1. We tend to look at people like [[Jeff Bezos]] or [[Steve Jobs]] and think, wow, they have everything figured out, they're so successful, they're just such leaders in their field.
2. And as humans, it's very easy for us to look up to somebody and believe and think that everything they say is true.
3. Everything they say is gospel, that any advice that they give is right for us.
4. You have to remember that each person gives advice based on things that worked in their life, their experiences which are unique to them.
5. And one of the best things you can do in your learning journey is not to just blindly follow the one person that you see that you trust, create the muscle, to not always agree with one person, create the muscle of looking at different opinions and different individuals and teachers to learn from because everybody has a unique perspective.
6. But oftentimes people that tell you, hey, I'm the only person you should listen to, I'm the one that's going to get you to success are often charlatans or what we call liars that are just trying to take advantage of you.
7. Don't listen to one person even though I'm teaching a course on efficient learning.
8. But what I'm saying is when you're learning a topic or even learning how to learn, don't just learn it from me.
9. Reach out to multiple sources, read from different writers, authors, because combining each individual piece from multiple people, is it better way to learn than just getting all your information from one source?
10. Form your own opinions, methods and tactics and techniques to learning that is unique to you based on multiple sources of information.
11. You will often find that the people who have really strong, hard opinions on something are often the people who are less knowledgeable. #imp-line
12. Most successful learners, or most people with really successful skills understand that there's usually pros and cons to everything.
13. The people who tell you that they know everything are often the ones that know the least.

### 4 Lie: [[10,000 Hours Rule]]

1. This rule was popularized in the book [[Outliers]] by [[Malcolm Gladwell]], but it actually stems from a 1993 study looking at a violinist's and this study was all about what makes a violinist an expert and what makes it violinists, just a good violinist.
2. So that is what's the difference between the top masters when it comes to violence and the ones who were just OK or good enough?
3. And this 1993 study was really exciting because what it reported was that those who were considered elite were the ones who practiced the most, this is the idea of deliberate practice, which we're going to get into [[The Technique]] section.
4. So this [[10,000 Hours Rule]] states that, The more you practice, The better you get.
5. If you put in 10000 hours into a skill, then you become a master of it.
6. But many studies have actually debunked this and a recent study in 2016 combined all these studies and looked at this original study to analyze it and see if it was accurate.
7. And it turns out that it wasn't really.
8. Yes, practice matters.
9. We can't forget that practice is a very important part of improving a skill.
10. However, there are many different factors involved, things like genetics, your past history, like your upbringing, your school, your friends, your personality actually contributes to how good you can get at a topic.
11. And that doesn't sound exciting, right?
12. Because it sounds like we have less control over what we can learn with the [[10,000 Hours Rule]]
13. We could say that, anybody can do anything that they want, which is just such a nice thing to hear.
14. But unfortunately, the truth of the matter is that we don't play in an even playing field in this world.
15. When you think that it's unfair that you want to play basketball by your short, well, that's life.
16. Life is unfair.
17. Not everybody starts at the same level.
18. When you think it's unfair that somebody with wealthy parents can go to a really nice school, go to expensive schools like Harvard.
19. Well, that is not fair, but that is life.
20. Everyone has advantages and disadvantages, and it's unrealistic for us to think that everyone is starting at the same place.
21. What we'll learn in this course is the idea that you don't have to be the hardest worker.
22. You don't have to be the person that puts in 80 hours a week of work.
23. We're going to focus on efficient learning which is all about learning smart instead of just banging our head, working as hard as we can and exhausting ourselves in the process.
24. What are the things that we can do so that instead of just blindly studying something for ten 10,000 hours.
25. And knowing that we don't play on an even playing field, how can we strategize and how can we use different techniques to actually get to a place where we become masters?
26. It's not as simple as just practicing, we can use the upcoming sections in the course to actually develop skills that allows us to learn efficiently.
27. Instead of going to the gym for two hours each day, we can get the same results with 20 minutes each day.

### Lie's Summary

- We just learned about [[The Principles]], the shift in mindset in our frame of mind and how we can prepare ourselves for efficient learning.
- And now we're ready to move on to the next part of our pyramid, and that is the lies, in order for us to keep moving we have to debunk some myths, when it comes to learning some advice that is often given turns out to actually not be true.
- And these are the things you've most likely heard about but may have assumed that it's true.
- So we're going to tackle these lies in this section so that moving forward we know how to avoid them combined with the principles.
- This is going to set us off for later sections.

1. Follow your Passion
   1. This is probably not a good advice.
   2. Shift your focus to getting so good that they can't ignore you.
   3. Just following your passion blindly is probably not good advice.
2. You Can Avoid Risk
   1. Risk is a part of life and those that do great things, those that are able to achieve things which involve learning, most likely involve risk.
   2. It involves making some sacrifices.
   3. It involves maybe trading up an opportunity for another opportunity.
   4. And when we get those butterflies in our stomach, that means we're doing something worthwhile.
3. Trust this One Person
   1. Trusting just one single source of truth.
   2. When we blindly follow somebody and think that everything they say is true, well, it often leads us into a very one dimensional way of thinking.
   3. We have the power of the Internet where we're able to learn from different sources, from different instructors and teachers.
   4. Use it & form your own opinions and thoughts.
   5. Nobody knows everything completely.
   6. And the ones with the strongest opinions are the ones that are least knowledgeable.
4. [[10,000 Hours Rule]]
   1. That is to get good at something, you just have to work hard and put in those hours.
   2. But it turns out that's not really the case.
   3. There's different factors that affect our ability to learn, and there are efficient ways to learn and not so efficient ways to learn to.
   4. People that spent 10 hours learning a topic are most likely going to end up a different level of knowledge at the end of ten hours based on different factors.
   5. Some factors are out of our control, but there are definitely factors that we can control, which is why we're going to explore later on in this course.
   6. The idea of this section was to throw these lies out there and understand that whenever you hear advice like this, it's most likely wrong.
   7. Now these are no longer the rules that are going to dictate our learning.
