##### 1. Remember that our Header Element has the header class, like this →

1. ![[Add Header Element in the HTML File#^858be8]]

##### 2. Then, We use the class selector and then the name of the class which is `header`, like this →

```css
.header {
  height: 95vh;
}
```

^823b56

- With this `95vh`
- Basically we are saying that at every point, the height of this box, of this element, should be 95% of the viewport height.
- We could put 100 here, then the element would always be exactly the same height as the viewport, but I chose to go with 95 to make it not 100%, but only almost 100%.
