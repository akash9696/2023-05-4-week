### Code

```start-multi-column
ID: ExampleRegion1
number of columns: 2
```

```html
<body>
  <header class="header"></header>
  <!-- We added this header element. -->
  <!-- If you're wondering why we're giving it a class name, instead of just selecting it in the CSS using the header element selector, it's because you want a class name on each and every element here in the html. -->
</body>
```

--- end-column ---

```css

console.log()

```
