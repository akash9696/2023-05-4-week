- when things go wrong, parents blame themselves. They blame themselves for not acting in time, for not having instilled the correct values and for not being available when they were needed. ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=131))

- The DIY-ing starts well before the baby arrives. From breathing classes and setting up the nursery, ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=145))
- parents have to figure out everything on their own. ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=146))

- styles of parenting. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=152))
- All the attention of the parents are well-intentioned. It shows the eagerness of parents to prepare their children: ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=152))
- Prepare is the new care. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=154))
- Many children start computer programming as early as grade 5, ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=156))
- how many are taught about their emotional programming with the same enthusiasm. ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=156))
- highest rates of depression, substance abuse, anxiety disorders ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=160))
- We are feeding our children a super-sized diet of desire and ambition. The question is, are we doing enough to nurture a child’s inner growth? ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=163))
- baby product industry in the USA alone is around $30 billion, and it shows the eagerness of parents to do a good job. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=165))
- They enrol in parenting classes, read books ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=166))

- The Wisdom Bridge will channel the parents’ energies away from anxiety to appreciation. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=168))
- will give them a new appreciation of how to tap into their heart’s wisdom and raise happy and resilient children. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=168))
- will take the focus away from prepare and put the spotlight back on care. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=169))
- Preparing children is like teaching them the block and tackle of surviving in the world ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=170))
- don’t talk to strangers, follow a routine, study hard, don’t eat junk food and so on. ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=171))
- transactional side of parenting. ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=171))
- it’s essential, and it’s a lot of work. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=172))
- on its own, ‘prepare’ is an incomplete idea. ‘Care’, on the other hand, includes nurturing the child spiritually, mentally, emotionally and physically. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=172))
- Prepare pushes the parents to ‘do more, do more’, while care guides the parents to ‘do what matters’. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=173))
- Prepare is a transaction, while care is a deep relationship. ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=174))
- Care comes from a place of ‘What is good for my child’s development?’ Care is a long-term view of the child’s flourishing in life. Care is a sacred activity and it begins at home. ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=175))
- caring is the real preparing. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=176))
- Children are affected by many things—the environment at home, the neighbourhood they live in, the school they attend, their friends, the books they read, the media they are exposed to and so on. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=183))
- Wisdom takes away the anxiety that comes from trying to control everything and helps the parents focus on laying a strong foundation for the child. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=184))
- There are no perfect parents. We all learn on the job. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=186))
- The unconditional, innocent love from the children keeps the parents going. We all make mistakes. Each day we’ll find something, no matter how tiny, that we might have handled differently. It’s okay. Hug it out, resolve not to repeat it and move on. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=187))
- The Wisdom Bridge offers a simple framework of principles that are easy to apply. ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=192))
- When you’re in the dark and you reach for a matchbox, it doesn’t matter which match you choose to strike. They all give light. ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=192))

- In all, there are nine principles. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=195))
- Raising a child still takes a village. 2. Be guided by wisdom. Seek it. Cultivate it. Share it. 3. Preparation begins long before the children arrive. 4. Happy mothers make happy families. 5. Early childhood is the foundation of wisdom. 6. Character builds personality. 7. Youth are the future. Guide them, don’t break them. 8. Lifestyle is an expression of one’s attitudes. 9.

- By ‘togetherness’, I mean the togetherness of hearts. It’s the kindred feeling of closeness we experience with loved ones. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=226))
- Togetherness is the soul of this book ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=227))
- expressed in the idea that humanity thrives when we nurture the bonds that connect us. ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=228))
- And this nurturing begins in the family and continues in the village. ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=228))
- The African proverb, ‘It takes a village to raise a child’ conveys the idea of togetherness. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=229))
- where there is heart, there is love; and love strengthens togetherness. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=232))

- As children grow up, it becomes difficult for parents to give direct advice. Children rebel against direct instructions. At the same time, they look up to leader figures and role models outside their home. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=419))
- the presence of a grandmother helps develop better cognitive skills in children. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=423))

- Knowing all this in advance, parents can prepare for it by building the village for their child. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=426))
- the village is the people, not the place. ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=427))
- In halo parenting, parents consciously cultivate a network of friends and family members who can be present in the lives of their children as they grow into adolescence and teenagers. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=430))

- We find halo parents by becoming one for somebody. Not because there is reciprocity but because that is how a community works. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=494))
- A simple way to get started on the journey to becoming a halo parent is by finding common interests. ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=495))
- For example, you may like to paint and a child in your circle is interested in art. That’s a good place to start. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=496))
- Or you may like French and you may start a reading group with a couple of children interested in learning French. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=496))
- Shared interests are a great way to nurture a connection. ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=497))
- One may wonder, how do we create time for other children when we don’t have time for our own children? ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=498))
- This type of thinking is what created the problem in the first place. ([Location 499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=499))
- There’s strength in numbers, and support comes from unity. ([Location 499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=499))
- When we come together as halo parents, we are recreating the best of what large families offered while retaining our privacy and personal freedom. ([Location 499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=499))
- in the book of a box of matches. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=501))
- When it is dark, it does not matter which match you pick; they all give light. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=501))
- In the same way, halo parents are a collection of people with whom we nurture a relationship. We do not know who will come in handy when there is a need. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=502))
- It’s possible we may never use the matchbox. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=503))
- Halo parents are not just for troubled times. They are a silent presence in your child’s life. They make happy times happier and difficult times easier to get through. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=503))
- Becoming a halo parent is creating a bond of trust and care. It is a benevolent act of taking responsibility for someone who is not yours. At its core, it is about going back to one’s roots and rediscovering the universal brotherhood that makes us one large, thriving human family. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=505))
- My son has a very close friend at school, who also happens to be our neighbour. The friend’s parents are both working, so he often comes over to our place after school with my son. I almost feel as if I am his godmother but am scared about what his mother will think. What if my care and nurturing is seen as an interference? Daaji: I have two boys. They spent much of their childhood with their elder aunt. They were fortunate to have two mothers who raised them so well. Not everyone is as lucky. You are doing something similar. So don’t second-guess your intentions, especially when they are coming from the right place. Check in with your neighbour occasionally to see how she feels and if anything is bothering her. Such small talk should make it easier for you both. Love, care and discipline go hand in hand. ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=508))
- grandparents and grandchildren share a connection that makes even the mundane, memorable. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=521))
- In their togetherness, wisdom flows from one generation to another. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=521))
- what makes the connection between grandparents and grandchildren special goes back thousands of years ago, to our days as hunter-gatherers. ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=525))
- While parents hunted and foraged for food, the grandmothers taught the children how to spot water sources, how to make a fire and how to hunt; essentially, how to survive. ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=527))
- care and nurturing by our grandparents is one of the reasons why the human race survived, while other species stronger and bigger than we are were wiped out.1 ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=528))
- grandparents and grandchildren are hardwired in a way that grandparents share knowledge, and grandchildren imbibe them.2 ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=534))
- Thanks to this hardwiring, generational wisdom flows from one generation to another. ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=536))
- I refer to our elders as living wisdom bridges. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=539))
- To transfer wisdom, we build a wisdom bridge. ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=543))
- But when a child is with the grandparents and sees their kindness in actions, ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=545))
- the wisdom flows straight into the child’s heart. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=546))
- Centuries from now, when future humanity studies modern-day society, what will they find? Will they discover that we preserved wisdom? ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=552))
- stories from two ancient cultures ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=554))
- For centuries these cultures thrived, thanks to strong wisdom bridges, but today they are dying as the wisdom bridges collapse. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=554))
- Our detour into the Pacific islands and the Amazon shows that the generations before us faced problems like what we are facing today. ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=605))
- The elders in your family have life skills and learnings relevant to your family’s flourishing. They may not have all the answers, but you can learn from their successes and failures. ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=606))
- You can blend wisdom and technology to create a lifestyle that helps your family thrive. ([Location 607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=607))
- Be curious to learn more about age-old customs and practices. Instead of discarding them as superstitions and rituals, distil the essence behind the customs and take what is valuable. ([Location 609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=609))
- Understanding the importance of generational wisdom today will prepare you for the future. ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=613))
- What you share then will be the wisdom that your family’s future generations will carry forward. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=614))
- It’s important to remember that the past wasn’t perfect. ([Location 617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=617))
- you learn that prejudice, jealousy and greed affected their generations too. ([Location 618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=618))
- But a lot of good was passed down from one generation to another, and a lot of evil also made its way down. ([Location 619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=619))
- it’s our responsibility to sift through what we receive and discern wisdom from waste. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=621))
- We need to make wisdom relevant again in our lives, through the wise who can pour it into those hearts that can receive it. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=631))
- My children love reading and listening to stories. Their grandfather, who lives in a different city, instilled the habit of reading in them, and of listening to the exciting stories he’d tell. They miss their grandfather. I would love to tell them stories, but they just tell me I’m not doing it as well as he did. What should I do? Daaji: Most families today live far away from each other. So, we should use technology to bridge the gap. Set up a regular time for your children and their grandfather to speak. Your role as a parent is to set up the conversation so that they meet regularly. Fix the timings, use a good device, ensure the internet bandwidth is good and so on. Try to remove the friction points that technology may cause. This will make it easier for the elders to use technology. The elders are more comfortable in-person, and they find it easier to communicate this way. Initially, on a video call or e-meet, you may have to suggest some ideas, give some prompts to help them get into a flow. You only need to do this a few times here and there and then the conversation starts to flow. If you can, try and record some of these sessions. You will enjoy seeing them with the children when they grow up. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=633))
- My grandmother was a quiet lady. ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=644))
- Each morning, she placed one or two flowers at the deities’ photographs in our living room and then stood there with folded hands. ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=644))
- When her eyes closed, I could see how she melted away in the silence. After a few minutes, she would open her eyes and walk away still lost in thoughts of the Lord. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=645))
- I used to watch her from a corner in the room. ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=646))
- Even though no words were exchanged between us, ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=647))
- for me those moments were a masterclass in reverence towards the ultimate. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=647))
- Just as I had observed my grandmother, my little granddaughter was observing me. She saw that I was about to start my meditation and she wanted to make sure the house was silent. In her eyes, I saw the same feeling I used to have when my grandmother offered her prayers. Life came full circle for me that day. ([Location 653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=653))
- Wisdom is not taught, it is caught. ([Location 655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=655))
- The intentions, thoughts and actions of the elders are caught by the hearts of the young ones. ([Location 655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=655))
- Wisdom is so simple that it escapes our attention. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=663))
- It’s not a grand shiny object that one finds at the end of a quest. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=664))
- Instead, it’s like the air we breathe. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=664))
- All pervasive, invisible and vital for one’s life. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=664))
- Elders do not go about touting their wisdom because they don’t know they’re wise. To them, they’re just getting on with their lives. ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=676))
- you may have more money and better know-how than the elders, the elders have more experience. ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=678))
- They know how life changes when we go from the vitality of the twenties to the midlife crisis of the fifties. ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=679))
- They may not be eloquent in sharing their life ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=681))
- but if you pay attention, you can pick up good habits to apply in your own lives. ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=681))
- It is for you to observe, ask questions and learn from their lives. ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=683))
- you can learn from their minimalist lifestyle. ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=688))

- you need to peel the layers and discover the wisdom behind the actions of your elders. ([Location 690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=690))
- Grandchildren do particularly well in learning from the elders because children are innocent. They don’t have rigid egos that say, ‘Yes, I know everything there’s to know.’ ([Location 692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=692))
- They are eager to learn and don’t resist learning. ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=693))
- I once met a gentleman who told me about a game he plays with his grandchildren. He picks some names of politicians, rockstars or even criminals from his generation. ([Location 697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=697))
- Next up, the grandchildren pick some names: social media influencers, rappers, scientists and so on. ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=699))

- But in a generational chasm, the elders and the young ones share no common ground, ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=705))
- Think about the elders in your family and see how they can teach your children. For example, an elder in your family may be an excellent cook. Set up a weekend cooking class so that you and your children can learn from an expert. Someone else in the family may be a history teacher. Why not set up story times with lessons from history? ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=707))
- Because we don’t share common ground, other than looking after the children, most of us don’t know where else to involve elders. ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=710))
- Our fast-paced lives also make us feel that elders slow us down. ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=710))
- But we forget that their presence is what makes the difference. ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=711))

- New generations thought the past was no longer relevant. ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=760))
- No doubt, the scrolls were a source of great knowledge. ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=760))
- But the scrolls didn’t hold the wisdom. It was the great minds of scholars such as Euclid, Eratosthenes and Heron who churned knowledge to generate wisdom. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=761))
- Without the elders to teach and the young ones to learn, the scrolls were just mouldy souvenirs of the past. ([Location 762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=762))
- present times are different. We have the unique opportunity to harness wisdom and technology. ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=764))

- Daily Dilemma: As a young child, I used to read moral stories. But I hesitate to give the same books to my child. Are the morals in the stories too old? Are they still relevant in the present times, relevant for my child? Daaji: I understand your confusion. The times have changed, but the narrative in the stories hasn’t kept up. Here’s an example you can relate to. Cultures across the world recommend fasting. It was recommended for religious reasons. But today, we know through science the benefits of fasting and time-restricted eating. The practice of fasting remains the same, but the narrative has changed. Morals and values are always relevant. What is needed is the right social context to explain the story. So, you, as the parent, need to play the translator so the children can enjoy the story and appreciate the wisdom. Some time ago, our team worked on a project to recast the stories from the Vedas and explain the wisdom behind them. The book was well received, particularly by parents.

- Besides biological rhythms, the other reason to have children sooner is the energy it takes to raise them. ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=835))
- When parents are younger, their energy levels are higher. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=837))

For the men who are reading this, try to do everything your wife does at home for a week. Getting the children ready, the chores and everything else. It will give you an appreciation of how much effort it takes to run the house. And for the wives, who may not be paying attention to financial planning, investments and other tasks often handled by men, start taking interest.

- My husband and I often have arguments. Sometimes things get loud. Should I be worried about the psychological impact this will have on my child? Daaji: I suggest you and your husband try ‘postponing anger’. In general, most of us are experts at postponing. We postpone exercise, meditation, financial planning and many other things in life. Try postponing anger. You will be delighted with the results.

- One of the chakras, vital for fetal development, is the Brahmarandhra. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=971))

- Through the heart the soul’s life-force reaches all the chakras in the body. ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BBSH5XZX&location=978))
- When the wife and husband love each other and support each other in leading a life of meaning and purpose, their attitude at the time of conception creates a vibratory field that will be different from the vibratory field created by someone with bad attitude and a misguided inner compass.

To eliminate doubt, one must prepare. Most of the time, we are nervous because of our lack of preparation. As you plan for a baby, you and your husband can start meditating.
