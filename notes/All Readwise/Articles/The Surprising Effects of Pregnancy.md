# Document Notes

Document Note: This document describes the physical changes that a woman's body goes through during pregnancy. It covers changes in the organs, muscles and joints, hormones, the immune system, and the heart and lungs. It also covers changes in the brain, although research on this subject is still limited. It highlights the fact that most research to date has focused on the fetus rather than the pregnant woman's experiences. Finally, it mentions the science behind in vitro fertilization.
