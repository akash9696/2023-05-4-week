- created his own purpose-centered therapy, in Japan. It (Location 534)
- psychotherapist, Shoma Morita was a Zen Buddhist, and (Location 536)
- his therapy left a lasting spiritual mark on Japan. (Location 536)
- Many Western forms of therapy focus on controlling or modifying the patientâ€TMs emotions. In (Location 537)
- Morita therapy focuses on teaching patients to accept their emotions without trying to control them, (Location 538)
- In addition to accepting the patientâ€TMs emotions, Morita therapy seeks to â€œcreateâ€ new emotions on the basis of actions. According to Morita, these emotions are learned through experience and repetition. (Location 540)
- it teaches us to accept our desires, anxieties, fears, and worries, and let them go. As (Location 542)
- in his book Morita Therapy and the True Nature of Anxiety-Based Disorders, â€œIn (Location 543)
- â€œIn feelings, it is best to be wealthy and generous.â€ (Location 544)
- become more trapped in their own suffering when they try to escape from their fears and discomfort.5 (Location 546)
- Accept your feelings. If (Location 549)
- we should not try to control them or (Location 549)
- If we do, they become more intense. Regarding (Location 550)
- We donâ€TMt create our feelings; they simply come to us, and we have to accept them. The (Location 551)
- Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh, who (Location 553)
- Do what you should be doing. (Location 555)
- shouldnâ€TMt focus on eliminating symptoms, because (Location 555)
- should focus instead on the present moment, and (Location 556)
- we should avoid intellectualizing the situation. The (Location 557)
- The therapistâ€TMs mission is to develop the patientâ€TMs character so he or she can face any situation, and (Location 557)
- Morita therapy does (Location 558)
- allows them to learn from their actions and activities. It (Location 559)
- doesnâ€TMt tell you how to meditate, or how to keep a diary the way Western therapies do. (Location 559)
- It is up to the patient to make discoveries through experience. (Location 560)
- Discover your lifeâ€TMs purpose. We (Location 560)
- We canâ€TMt control our emotions, but we can take charge of our actions every day. This (Location 561)
- we should have a clear sense of our purpose, and always keep Moritaâ€TMs mantra in mind: â€œWhat do we need to be doing right now? What (Location 561)
- What action should we be taking?â€ (Location 562)
- key to achieving this is having dared to look inside yourself to find your ikigai. (Location 563)
- lasts fifteen to twenty-one days, consists of the following stages: (Location 565)
- Isolation and rest (five to seven days). During (Location 566)
- All the patient has is his thoughts. He lies down for most of the day and is visited regularly by the therapist, who (Location 567)
- therapist simply advises the patient to continue observing the rise and fall of his emotions as (Location 568)
- When the patient gets bored and wants to start doing things again, he is ready to move on to the next stage of therapy. (Location 569)
- Light occupational therapy (five to seven days). In (Location 571)
- performs repetitive tasks in silence. One (Location 571)
- keeping a diary about his thoughts and feelings. The (Location 572)
- after a week of being shut in, takes walks in nature, and (Location 572)
- does breathing exercises. He (Location 572)
- starts doing simple activities, such as gardening, drawing, or painting. During (Location 573)
- not allowed to talk to anyone, except the therapist. (Location 573)
- Occupational therapy (five to seven days). (Location 574)
- In this stage, the patient performs tasks that require physical movement. Dr. (Location 574)
- to the mountains to chop wood. In (Location 575)
- immersed in other activities, such as writing, painting, or making ceramics. The (Location 576)
- patient can speak with others at this stage, but only about the tasks at hand. (Location 576)
- The return to social life and the â€œrealâ€ world. The (Location 577)
- patient leaves the hospital and is reintroduced to social life, but maintains the practices of meditation and occupational therapy developed during treatment. The (Location 578)
- reenter society as a new person, with a sense of purpose, and without being controlled by social or emotional pressures. (Location 579)
- Morita was a great Zen master of Naikan introspective meditation. Much (Location 581)
- his therapy draws (Location 581)
- centers on three questions the individual must ask him- or herself: (Location 582)
- What have I received from person X? What have I given to person X? What problems have I caused person X? (Location 583)
- Through these reflections, we stop identifying others as the cause of our problems and deepen our own sense of responsibility. As (Location 586)
- Morita said, â€œIf (Location 587)
- angry and want to fight, think about it for three days before (Location 587)
- After three days, the intense desire to fight will pass on its own.â€7 (Location 587)
- ikigai, your existential fuel. Once (Location 591)
- Once you find it, it is only a matter of having the courage and making the effort to stay on the right path. (Location 592)
- Bruce Lee described with his famous â€œBe water, my friend.â€ (Location 612)
- Weâ€TMve all felt our sense of time vanish when we lose ourselves in an activity we enjoy. (Location 613)
- opposite can also happen. (Location 616)
- When we have to complete a task we donâ€TMt want to do, every minute feels like a lifetime and we canâ€TMt stop looking at our watch. (Location 617)
- someone else might really enjoy the same task, but we want to finish as quickly as possible. (Location 619)
- What makes us enjoy doing something so much that we forget about whatever worries we might have while we do it? When are we happiest? These questions can help us discover our ikigai. (Location 620)
- psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyiâ€TMs (Location 623)
- asserts in his book Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, (Location 630)
- flow is â€œthe state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.â€ (Location 631)
- require the high doses of concentration that promote flow. (Location 633)
- Most athletes, chess players, and engineers also spend much of their time on activities that bring them to this state. (Location 634)
- flow is the same among individuals of all ages and cultures. (Location 637)
- When we flow, we are focused on a concrete task without any distractions. (Location 639)
- there are several strategies you can employ to increase your chances of achieving flow. (Location 641)
- researcher Owen Schaffer of DePaul University, the requirements for achieving flow are: (Location 643)
- Knowing what to do Knowing how to do it Knowing how well you are doing Knowing where to go (where navigation is involved) Perceiving significant challenges Perceiving significant skills Being free from distractions1 (Location 645)
- Strategy 1: Choose a difficult task (but not too difficult!) (Location 651)
- Schafferâ€TMs model encourages us to take on tasks that we have a chance of completing but that are slightly outside our comfort zone. (Location 651)
- Every task, sport, or job has a set of rules, (Location 653)
- and we need a set of skills to follow them. (Location 653)
- Activities that are too easy lead to apathy. (Location 655)
- The ideal is to find a middle path, something aligned with our abilities but just a bit of a stretch, so we experience it as a challenge. (Location 657)
- Ernest Hemingway (Location 658)
- said, â€œSometimes I write better than I can.â€2 (Location 658)
- we enjoy the feeling of pushing ourselves. (Location 660)
- Bertrand Russell (Location 660)
- â€œTo be able to concentrate for a considerable amount of time is essential to difficult achievement.â€3 (Location 660)
- try to incorporate into your next routine a movement that has seemed impossible for years. (Location 663)
- Add a little something extra, something that takes you out of your comfort zone. (Location 664)
- if the book is appropriate to our knowledge and abilities, and builds on what we already know, weâ€TMll immerse ourselves in our reading, and time will flow. This pleasure and satisfaction are evidence that we are in tune with our ikigai. (Location 669)
- Easy Challenging Beyond Our Abilities Boredom Flow Anxiety (Location 672)
- Strategy 2: Have a clear, concrete objective (Location 677)
- Video gamesâ€”played in moderationâ€”board games, and sports are great ways to achieve flow, (Location 678)
- because the objective tends to be very clear: Beat your rival or your own record while following a set of explicitly defined rules. (Location 679)
- According to a study by Boston Consulting Group, (Location 681)
- employees at multinational corporations is that they donâ€TMt â€œcommunicate the teamâ€TMs mission clearly,â€ and that, as a result, the employees donâ€TMt know what their objectives are. (Location 682)
- It is much more important to have a compass pointing to a concrete objective than to have a map. (Location 686)
- Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab, encourages us to use the principle (Location 686)
- In the book Whiplash: How to Survive Our Faster Future, (Location 687)
- he and Jeff Howe write, (Location 688)
- a detailed map may lead you deep into the woods at an unnecessarily high cost. A good compass, though, will always take you where you need to go. (Location 688)
- It doesnâ€TMt mean that you should start your journey without any idea where youâ€TMre going. (Location 689)
- it does mean is understanding that while the path to (Location 690)
- your goal may not be straight, youâ€TMll finish faster and more efficiently than you would have if you had trudged along a preplanned route.â€ (Location 690)
- itâ€TMs important to reflect on what we hope to achieve before starting to work, study, or make something. (Location 692)
- Having a clear objective is important in achieving flow, but we also have to know how to leave it behind when we get down to business. (Location 698)
- As soon as you take these first small steps, your anxiety will disappear and you will achieve a pleasant flow in the activity youâ€TMre doing. (Location 709)
- Albert Einstein, â€œa happy man is too satisfied with the present to dwell on the future.â€4 (Location 710)
- Strategy 3: Concentrate on a single task (Location 722)
- We often think that combining tasks will save us time, but scientific evidence shows that it has the opposite effect. (Location 728)
- Even those who claim to be good at multitasking are not very productive. In fact, they are some of the least productive people. (Location 729)
- Concentrating on one thing at a time may be the single most important factor in achieving flow. (Location 734)
- To be in a distraction-free environment (Location 736)
- To have control over what we are doing at every moment (Location 737)
- Technology is great, if weâ€TMre in control of it. Itâ€TMs not so great if it takes control of us. (Location 738)
- It has been scientifically shown that if we continually ask our brains to switch back and forth between tasks, we waste time, make more mistakes, and remember less of what weâ€TMve done. (Location 741)
- studies conducted at Stanford University by Clifford Ivar Nass describe (Location 743)
- our generation as suffering from an epidemic of multitasking. (Location 744)
- Their brains were trained to pay attention to every stimulus, regardless of its importance, while the brains of the other students were trained to focus on a single taskâ€”in this case, counting the red arrows and ignoring the blue ones.5 (Location 752)
- Other studies indicate that working on several things at once lowers our productivity by at least 60 percent and our IQ by more than ten points. (Location 754)
- study funded by the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research (Location 756)
- twenty and twenty-four who were addicted to their smartphones got less sleep, felt less connected to their community at school, and were more likely to show signs of depression.6 (Location 757)
- few ideas for creating a space and time free of distractions, to increase our chances of reaching a state of flow and thereby getting in touch with our ikigai: (Location 778)
- Donâ€TMt look at any kind of screen for the first hour youâ€TMre awake and the last hour before you go to sleep. (Location 780)
- Turn off your phone before you achieve flow. (Location 781)
- enable the â€œdo not disturbâ€ function so only the people closest to you can contact you in case of emergency. (Location 783)
- Designate one day of the week, (Location 784)
- technological â€œfasting,â€ making exceptions only for e-readers (without Wi-Fi) or MP3 players. (Location 785)
- Go to a cafÃ© that doesnâ€TMt have Wi-Fi. (Location 786)
- Read and respond to e-mail only once or twice per day. Define those times clearly and stick to them. (Location 787)
- Try the Pomodoro Technique: (Location 788)
- The Pomodoro Technique recommends 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of rest for each cycle, but you can also do 50 minutes of work and 10 minutes of rest. (Location 789)
- Find the pace thatâ€TMs best for you; (Location 790)
- the most important thing is to be disciplined in completing each cycle. (Location 790)
- Start your work session with a ritual you enjoy and end it with a reward. (Location 791)
- Practice mindfulness or another form of meditation, go for a walk or a swimâ€”whatever will help you get centered again. (Location 793)
- Work in a space where you will not be distracted. (Location 795)
- keep looking until you find the right place. (Location 796)
- Divide each activity into groups of related tasks, and assign each group its own place and time. (Location 797)

- Japanese people often apply themselves to even the most basic tasks with an intensity that borders on obsession. (Location 832)
- stores that sell handcrafted objects in Naha, Kanazawa, or Kyoto and youâ€TMll also discover that Japan is a treasure trove of traditional craftwork. (Location 836)
- The people of Japan have a unique talent for creating new technologies while preserving artisanal traditions and techniques. (Location 837)
- The art of the takumi (Location 839)
- Toyota employs â€œartisansâ€ who are able to make a certain type of screw by hand. These takumi, or experts in a particular manual skill, are extremely important to Toyota, (Location 839)
- Turntable needles are another example: Theyâ€TMre produced almost exclusively in Japan, (Location 842)
- precision needles, (Location 843)
- We met a takumi on a visit to Kumano, a small town near Hiroshima. (Location 845)
- we still hadnâ€TMt seen anyone actually putting bristles into the brush heads. (Location 850)
- president of one company agreed to show us how it was done. (Location 851)
- She was so focused (Location 854)
- she didnâ€TMt even notice our presence. Her movements were so quick it was hard to tell what she was doing. (Location 855)
- She looked happy and proud talking about her work and responsibilities. (Location 858)
- The president told us that this takumi was one of the most important people in the company, even though she was hidden away in a separate building. Every bristle of every brush the company made passed through her hands. (Location 861)
- Steve Jobs in Japan (Location 863)
- Apple cofounder Steve Jobs was a big fan of Japan. (Location 863)
- he visit the Sony factories in the 1980s and adopt many of their methods when he founded Apple, (Location 864)
- who won Steve Jobsâ€TMs devotion, but rather a takumi from Toyama named Yukio Shakunaga, who used a technique called Etchu Seto-yaki, known by only a few. (Location 866)
- Jobs returned to Kyoto several times (Location 870)
- ended up meeting Shakunaga in person. (Location 871)
- Jobs had many questions for himâ€”almost all of them about the fabrication process and the type of porcelain he used. (Location 871)
- Shakunaga explained that he used white porcelain he extracted himself from mountains in the Toyama (Location 872)
- Jobs was so impressed that he considered going to Toyama to see the mountain (Location 875)
- In an interview after Jobsâ€TMs death, Shakunaga said he was very proud that his work had been appreciated by the man who created the iPhone. He (Location 876)
- Jobsâ€TMs last purchase from him had been a set of twelve teacups. Jobs had asked for something special, â€œa new style.â€ To satisfy this request, Shakunaga made 150 teacups in the process of testing out new ideas. Of these, he chose the twelve best and sent them to the Jobs family. (Location 877)
- Ever since his first trip to Japan, Jobs was fascinated and inspired by the countryâ€TMs artisans, engineers (especially at Sony), philosophy (especially Zen), and cuisine (especially sushi).7 (Location 880)
- Japanese artisans, engineers, Zen philosophy, and cuisine have in common? (Location 883)
- Simplicity and attention to detail. (Location 884)
- not a lazy simplicity but a sophisticated one (Location 884)
- always taking the object, the body and mind, or the cuisine to the next level, according to oneâ€TMs ikigai. (Location 885)
- As Csikszentmihalyi would say, the key is always having a meaningful challenge to overcome in order to maintain flow. (Location 886)
- documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi gives us another example of a takumi, this time in the kitchen. (Location 887)
- Doesnâ€TMt he get bored cooking eggs every day? No, because making sushi is his ikigai, too. (Location 892)
- when they cookâ€”they achieve a state of flow. (Location 894)
- Theyâ€TMve learned to take pleasure in their work, to lose their sense of time. (Location 895)

- The Japanese are skilled at bringing nature and technology together: not man versus nature, but rather a union of the two. (Location 907)
- Miyazaki (Location 915)
- uses a cell phone from the late 1990s, and he makes his entire team draw by hand. He â€œdirectsâ€ his films by rendering on paper even the tiniest detail, achieving flow by drawing, not by using a computer. (Location 916)
- Thanks to this obsession on the directorâ€TMs part, Studio Ghibli is one of the only studios in the world where almost the entire production process is carried out using traditional techniques. (Location 917)
- In 2013, Miyazaki announced he was going to retire. (Location 923)
- instead of going on vacation or staying at home, he went to Studio Ghibli and sat down to draw. (Location 928)
- One year later, he announced he wouldnâ€TMt make any more feature films but that he would keep on drawing until the day he died. (Location 929)
- Can someone really retire if he is passionate about what he does? (Location 930)
- not only the Japanese (Location 932)

- Einstein wrote before closing his eyes forever was a formula that attempted to unite all the forces of the universe in a single theory. (Location 934)
- Reaching a state of flow while working on his formulas or playing music, his two ikigais, brought him endless pleasure. (Location 936)
- Many such artists might seem misanthropic or reclusive, but what they are really doing is protecting the time that brings them happiness, (Location 938)
- novelist Haruki Murakami. He sees only a close circle of friends, and appears in public in Japan only once every few years. (Location 940)
- Artists know how important it is to protect their space, control their environment, and be free of distractions if they want to flow with their ikigai. (Location 941)
- laundry, mow the lawn, or attend to paperwork? Is there a way to make these mundane tasks enjoyable? (Location 944)
- performing a whole sequence of movements. (Location 951)
- Csikszentmihalyi calls this microflow. (Location 953)
- Our ability to turn routine tasks into moments of microflow, into something we enjoy, is key to our being happy, since we all have to do such tasks. (Location 956)
- Bill Gates washes the dishes every night. (Location 957)
- Richard Feynman, one of the most important physicists of all time, also took pleasure in routine tasks. (Location 960)

- one of the founders of the supercomputer manufacturer Thinking Machines, (Location 961)
- When he didnâ€TMt have something important to do or needed to rest his mind, Feynman dedicated himself to microflowingâ€”say, painting the office walls. (Location 966)
- Training the mind can get us to a place of flow more quickly. Meditation is one way to exercise our mental muscles. (Location 971)
- objective: calming the mind, observing our thoughts and emotions, and centering our focus on a single object. (Location 973)
- By fixing your attention on the air moving in and out of your nose, you can slow the torrent of thoughts and clear your mental horizons. (Location 975)

- these waves appear right away, while it might take a half hour for a beginner to experience them. (Location 989)
- activated right before we fall asleep, as we lie in the sun, or right after taking a hot bath. (Location 990)
- Life is inherently ritualistic. (Location 993)
- When doing business in Japan, process, manners, and how you work on something is more important than the final results. (Location 999)
- Rituals give us clear rules and objectives, which help us enter a state of flow. (Location 1002)
- When we have only a big goal in front of us, we might feel lost or overwhelmed by it; rituals help us by giving us the process, the substeps, on the path to achieving a goal. (Location 1002)
- When confronted with a big goal, try to break it down into parts and then attack each part one by one. (Location 1003)
- enjoying your daily rituals, using them as tools to enter a state of flow. (Location 1005)
- outcomeâ€”it will come naturally. (Location 1005)
- Happiness is in the doing, not in the result. (Location 1005)
- As a rule of thumb, remind yourself: â€œRituals over goals.â€ (Location 1006)
- The happiest people are not the ones who achieve the most. They are the ones who spend more time than others in a state of flow. (Location 1007)
- which activities in your life make you enter flow. Write all of them on a piece of paper, (Location 1010)
- ask yourself these questions: (Location 1010)
- What do the activities that drive you to flow have in common? (Location 1011)
- Why do those activities drive you to flow? (Location 1011)
- are all the activities you most like doing ones that you practice alone or with other people? (Location 1011)
- Do you flow more when doing things that require you to move your body or just to think? (Location 1012)
- In the answers to these questions you might find the underlying ikigai that drives your life. (Location 1013)
- you donâ€TMt, then keep searching by going deeper into what you like by spending more of your time in the activities that make you flow. (Location 1014)
- Flow is mysterious. It is like a muscle: the more you train it, the more you will flow, and the closer you will be to your ikigai. (Location 1017)
- supercentenariansâ€”people (Location 1028)
- The term was coined in 1970 by Norris McWhirter, editor of The Guinness Book of World Records. Its use became more widespread in the 1990s, after it appeared in William Strauss and Neil Howeâ€TMs Generations. (Location 1029)

- knows how to live in the here and now: â€œYou stay in your time. You donâ€TMt go backward. I think if you relate to the time youâ€TMre in, you keep your eyes and ears open, read the paper, see whatâ€TMs going on, stay curious about everything, you will automatically be in your time.â€15 (Location 1137)
- many of those verified as having lived the longest are found in the United States; (Location 1142)
- longevity in Japan is closely tied to its culture, (Location 1146)
- The sense of community, and the fact that Japanese people make an effort to stay active until the very end, are key elements of their secret to long life. (Location 1147)

- is immortal and makes us who we are. (Location 1242)

- Elevate the crown of your head, and focus all your energy there. Tighten your chest and expand your back to lighten your lower body. Relax your waist and let it guide your body. Learn to differentiate between heaviness and lightness, knowing how your weight is distributed. Relax the shoulders to allow free movement of the arms and promote the flow of energy. Value the agility of the mind over the strength of the body. Unify the upper and lower body so they act in concert. Unify the internal and the external to synchronize mind, body, and breath. Do not break the flow of your movement; maintain fluidity and harmony. Look for stillness in movement. An active body leads to a calm mind. (Location 1617)

Rotate your hands to feel the energy of your heart. Turn from your waist gently to the left, keeping your torso relaxed and your forearms parallel to the ground. With your palms still facing each other, separate your hands, bringing one up until it is level with your shoulder, and the other down in front of your abdomen. Turn from your waist gently to the right, keeping your torso relaxed and your forearms parallel to the ground. As you exhale, let your hands come back together in front of your heart.

- involves the coordination of movement, breathing, and pronouncing sounds with the purpose of bringing our souls to a place of calm. (Location 1740)
- The six sounds are: (Location 1741)
- Xu, pronounced like â€œshhâ€ with a deep sigh, which is associated with the liver He, pronounced like â€œherâ€ with a yawn, which is associated with the heart Si, pronounced like â€œsirâ€ with a slow exhale, which is associated with the lungs Chui, pronounced like â€œchweeâ€ with a forceful exhale, which is associated with the kidneys Hoo, pronounced like â€œwho,â€ which is associated with the spleen Xi, pronounced like â€œshe, â€ which connects the whole body (Location 1742)
- The following poem by Sun Simiao offers clues about how to live well according to the season. (Location 1750)
- reminds us of the importance of breathing, and suggests that as we breathe, we visualize the organs associated with each of the healing sounds. (Location 1750)
- In spring, breathe xu for clear eyes and so wood can aid your liver. In summer, reach for he, so that heart and fire can be at peace. In fall, breathe si to stabilize and gather metal, keeping the lungs moist. For the kidneys, next, breathe chui and see your inner waters calm. The Triple Heater needs your xi to expel all heat and troubles. In all four seasons, take deep breaths so your spleen can process food. And, of course, avoid exhaling noisily; donâ€TMt let even your own ears hear you. The practice is most excellent and will help preserve your divine elixir. (Location 1752)
- takeaway is that they all combine a physical exercise with an awareness of our breath. These two componentsâ€”movement and breathâ€”help us to bring our consciousness in line with our body, instead of allowing our mind to be carried away by the sea of daily worries. (Location 1762)
- Most of the time, we are just not aware enough of our breathing. (Location 1764)
- One thing that everyone with a clearly defined ikigai has in common is that they pursue their passion no matter what. They never give up, (Location 1772)
- Weâ€TMre talking about resilience, (Location 1774)

- SiddhÄrtha Gautama (Buddha) (Location 1794)
- He realized that a wise person should not ignore lifeâ€TMs pleasures. A wise person can live with these pleasures but should always remain conscious of how easy it is to be enslaved by them. (Location 1798)
- there is nothing wrong with enjoying lifeâ€TMs pleasures as long as they do not take control of your life (Location 1802)
- You have to be prepared for those pleasures to disappear. (Location 1803)
- goal is not to eliminate all feelings and pleasures from our lives, (Location 1804)
- but to eliminate negative emotions. (Location 1805)
- The objective of the virtuous person is to reach a state of tranquility (apatheia): the absence of negative feelings such as anxiety, fear, shame, vanity, and anger, and the presence of positive feelings such as happiness, love, serenity, and gratitude. (Location 1815)
- negative visualization: (Location 1817)
- They imagined the worst thing that could happen in order to be prepared if certain privileges and pleasures were taken from them. (Location 1817)

- As a result, he was able to answer the question â€œWhatâ€TMs the worst thing that could happen?â€ (Location 1823)
- another central tenet of Stoicism is knowing what we can control and what we canâ€TMt, (Location 1825)

- not what happens to you, but how you react that matters.â€1 (Location 1829)

- this way, we train our minds not to get swept up in anger, jealousy, or resentment. (Location 1833)
- the present is all that exists, and it is the only thing we can control. (Location 1839)
- the things we love are like the leaves of a tree: They can fall at any moment with a gust of wind. (Location 1844)
- the people we love will disappear at some point. (Location 1846)
- the impermanence of things does not have to make us sad; it should help us love the present moment and those who surround us. (Location 1847)
- Wabi-sabi is a Japanese concept that shows us the beauty of the fleeting, changeable, and imperfect nature of the world around us. (Location 1853)
- Only things that are imperfect, incomplete, and ephemeral can truly be beautiful, because only those things resemble the natural world. (Location 1856)
- A complementary Japanese concept is that of ichi-go ichi-e, which could be translated as â€œThis moment exists only now and wonâ€TMt come again.â€ (Location 1857)
- Greco-Roman architecture adores symmetry, sharp lines, imposing facades, and buildings and statues of the gods that outlast the centuries. (Location 1863)
- Japanese architecture, on the other hand, doesnâ€TMt try to be imposing or perfect, because it is built in the spirit of wabi-sabi. (Location 1865)
- The tradition of making structures out of wood presupposes their impermanence and the need for future generations to rebuild them. (Location 1866)
- Japanese culture accepts the fleeting nature of the human being and everything we create. (Location 1866)

- The key is to accept that there are certain things over which we have no control, like the passage of time (Location 1870)
- This is why it is so important to find and pursue our ikigai. (Location 1873)
- Nassim Nicholas Taleb (Location 1878)
- word fragile to describe people, things, and organizations that are weakened when harmed, and the words robust and resilient for things that are able to withstand harm without weakening, but we donâ€TMt have a word for things that get stronger when harmed (up to a point). (Location 1879)
- things that get stronger when they are harmed, Taleb proposes the term antifragile: (Location 1882)
- The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.â€ (Location 1883)
- how we can apply this concept to our daily lives. How can we be more antifragile? (Location 1899)
- Step 1: Create redundancies (Location 1900)
- Instead of having a single salary, try to find a way to make money from your hobbies, (Location 1900)
- if you have several options and you lose your primary job, (Location 1902)
- You would have beaten that stroke of bad luck and would be, in that case, antifragile. (Location 1904)
- as the saying goes, of not putting all your eggs in one basket. (Location 1907)
- Step 2: Bet conservatively in certain areas and take many small risks in others (Location 1914)
- The world of finance turns out to be very useful in explaining this concept. If you have $10,000 saved up, you might put $9,000 of that into an index fund or fixed-term deposit, and invest the remaining $1,000 in ten start-ups with huge growth potentialâ€”say, $100 in each. (Location 1915)
- The key to becoming antifragile is taking on small risks that might lead to great reward, without exposing ourselves to dangers that might sink us, (Location 1922)
- Step 3: Get rid of the things that make you fragile (Location 1924)
- What makes me fragile? Certain people, things, and habits generate losses for us and make us vulnerable. Who and what are they? (Location 1925)

- Taking a hit or two can be viewed as either a misfortune or an experience that we can apply to all areas of our lives, as we continually make corrections and set new and better goals. (Location 1936)
- â€œWe need randomness, mess, adventures, uncertainty, self-discovery, hear traumatic episodes, all these things that make life worth living.â€ (Location 1938)
- read Nassim Nicholas Talebâ€TMs Antifragile. (Location 1939)
- Life is pure imperfection, as the philosophy of wabi-sabi teaches us, and the passage of time shows us that everything is fleeting, but if you have a clear sense of your ikigai, each moment will hold so many possibilities that it will seem almost like an eternity. (Location 1940)
- Once you discover your ikigai, pursuing it and nurturing it every day will bring meaning to your life. The moment your life has this purpose, you will achieve a happy state of flow in all you do, like the calligrapher at his canvas or the chef who, after half a century, still prepares sushi for his patrons with love. (Location 1962)

- There is no perfect strategy to connecting with our ikigai. But what we learned from the Okinawans is that we should not worry too much about finding it. (Location 1973)
- Life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you. (Location 1974)

- their purpose in life. Thatâ€TMs why itâ€TMs so important to keep doing things of value, making progress, bringing beauty or utility to others, helping out, (Location 1980)
- Take it slow. (Location 1982)
- Being in a hurry is inversely proportional to quality of life. As the old saying goes, â€œWalk slowly and youâ€TMll go far.â€ (Location 1982)
- Donâ€TMt fill your stomach. (Location 1984)
