## Calories Needed

1. First of all you have to Calculate Calories your body needed before Pregnancy.
   - There are 2 main methods of calculating the Calories needed by your body.

### Problems

1. Appetite Loss
   1. Some women feel turned off of food completely. Why? And what can you do about it?
   2. While many women experience a bigger appetite, some don’t change their eating patterns& Others feel their appetite has come to a sudden halt.
   3. If you’re pregnant and not eating food, it may be concerning.
   4. Fortunately, losing your appetite can be normal during pregnancy
   5. Although you need more nutrients for the baby, your body may go through changes while it adapts.
   6. Your appetite will likely return. If it doesn’t or if you’re unable to eat, contact your doctor.
   7. Because your baby needs specific nutrients to develop, eating right during pregnancy is important.
   8. But there are ==7 reasons== you may want to eat less—instead of more—during pregnancy.
      1. **Aversions**
         1. Whether triggered by taste or smell, an aversion is a food that completely turns you off.
         2. Changes to food cravings and aversions usually happen in the 1 and 3 trimesters.
         3. The answer to why you’ve developed an aversion isn't clear.
         4. Some women believe their aversions or cravings are nature’s way of altering their diet, making it healthier for pregnancy.
         5. It’s possible your aversions could weaken your diet and affect your baby.
         6. The most common aversions include:
            1. Caffeinated drinks
            2. Meats
            3. Fish
            4. Eggs
            5. Biological, psychological, and environmental factors
      2. **Morning Sickness**
         1. For some women, food aversions can trigger vomiting.
         2. If you feel sick when you eat, eating can become less appealing.
         3. If you’re afraid of vomiting, you might only eat when necessary.
      3. **Decreased Food** = Adjusted Feelings of Fullness
         1. When you eat less food, your body will begin to adjust. Over time, it will take less food to make you feel full. Instead of feeling full after a meal, eating only half may leave you stuffed.
         2. Many people attribute this change in appetite to their “stomach shrinking.” However, your stomach doesn’t actually shrink—it just gets more sensitive to small amounts of food.
         3. If this happens, you’ll probably notice a reduced appetite as your body [learns to feel full](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4930427/) from less food.
         4. It’s important to recognise that even though you feel full, you might not be getting enough nutrients for the baby.
      4. **Constipation**
         1. If you’re unable to pass stools normally, you might avoid eating in fear that the problem will worsen.
         2. If food stays in your system longer, you might feel fuller.
         3. When there’s not much room for new food, your body won’t send hunger cues.
      5. **Extra Stomach Acid**
         1. Most commonly, women experience heartburn, AKA acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
         2. It can also worsen nausea and vomiting.
         3. The excess stomach acid could be making you feel full too quickly.
      6. **Mental Health**
         1. Anxiety and depression can lead to appetite changes.
         2. You might experience anxiety about your health, the baby, or upcoming life changes.
      7. **Body Image Concerns**
         1. If you’ve experienced body image issues or disordered eating before, pregnancy can trigger these concerns or make them worse.
   9. You can brainstorm possible solutions. Consider the ==7 suggestions== below.
